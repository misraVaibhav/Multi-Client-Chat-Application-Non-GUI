# Multi-Client Chat Application
A JAVA application that uses socket programming to create a chatting environment where all the clients can chat with each other privately or with all of them at once through server located at "localhost".

- Run the **Start-Server.bat** file once. *(Note that **StartServer.jar** file should also be in the same folder.)*
- Use **Start-Client.bat** file everytime you want to create a new client. *(The **StartClient.jar** should also be in the same folder.)*

## Chat
- Enter your name to be identified as a client.
- To send a message to all the available clients, simply write the message and press enter.
- To send a message privately to a specific client write your message as **private : *RecipientName*-*Message*** and press enter. (Here ***RecipientName*** is the receiver's name and ***Message*** is the message to send. )
